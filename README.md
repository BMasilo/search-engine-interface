Landing page of a fictional search engine called JungleCoffee.

Requirements:

The landing page should have a search bar (a place where a user types a search request) displayed prominently.

The page should have 2 buttons below the search box (like Google does), which use rollovers to provide users feedback with the mouse

User icons and a small menu should be displayed in the upper right corner (like you see when you’re signed in to a Google account)

A logo (you can create one if you’d like) or text should be displayed above the search bar

Display some text below the buttons

(Optional) Include a picture as the background like Bing does

The page must be responsive to different screen sizes, so it displays nicely on a large desktop monitor or a small smartphone screen
